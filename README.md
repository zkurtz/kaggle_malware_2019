#  Malware Kaggle challenge

Set up with Python 3+. Install the help library zpylib by `pip install -e .`.

- Configure your project storage directory (storage_dir) as in EXAMPLE_USER_CONFIG
- Populate your storage_dir with the directories in the storage directory tree below
- Download the kaggle data into `[storage_dir]/data/raw` , except the example 
submission file goes in `[storage_dir]/data/submit`
- Run `bash build_data/build.sh` to build the data (various cleaning and featurization steps)
- Run one of the scripts in `build_models/` to build a model

Storage directory tree:

```buildoutcfg
.
├── data
│   ├── metadata
│   ├── raw
│   ├── refactored
│   └── submit
└── models
```
